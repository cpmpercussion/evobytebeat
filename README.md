Evolutionary Bytebeats - evolving tiny programs to create digital audio!

## How to bytebeat?

0. install some stuff
  - [deap](https://github.com/deap/deap): `pip install deap`
  - [sox](http://sox.sourceforge.net): macOS: `brew install sox` ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install sox`
1. run `./play-python.sh` to evolve and play three bytebeats.
2. rock out!

## What's a bytebeat?

Short computer programs (one expression) that output samples of digital audio! Send them to a speaker for good times all around!
